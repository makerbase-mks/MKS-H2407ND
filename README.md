# MKS-H2407ND
# Feature:
* Extremely small size, only 5.5cm√ó5.5cm.
* Support motor voltage 7-24V, under voltage protection.
* Dual motor interface, each rated output current is 7A.
* Similar to L298N drive logic, each channel supports three-wire control enable, forward and reverse rotation and brake.
* The enable signal can be connected to an external PWM, and the forward and reverse control signals can be connected in series with limit switches.
* The control signal uses the sink current driving method, which supports the direct driving of most single-chip microcomputers.
* Use optocouplers to isolate all control signals.
* With electrostatic discharge circuit.
